## Git

### Commit messages

Ticket number: message what was done

Example: MNP-1: Add user api test

Commits should be small (in most cases) and message should show exact chunk of work

If there is no ticket, use No-ticket prefix.

Example: No-ticket: hotfix with user registration

> Note as about running tests and lint check before pushing your work to remote repository

### What should be done before you push your code to remote repo

* All features should have tests
* All tests should be passed before pushing your code
* All lints should be passed
