Hi, my name is Bohdan, and I'm creator of the project and here I want to describe some basic stuff
to make your life easier.

Let's get to know each other and our values or at the moment mine :D.

First of all, we communicate in english. It's okay not to be master in it.

* We respect each other and support interest of each other.
* Any questions are important even if you think it's stupid.
* We are keeping balance in our life in all sphere of it as we can.
* Don't blame others and no any other toxic behavior,
  but it's not about be like a fish and don't say anything! We are people and hope leaving in free countries so be
  yourself
  don't be afraid to say something but be ready to be stopped by someone
  if you are doing something shameful and
  don't be afraid to defend someone else if you see that he needs your help or asks it
* We want to cultivate open-minded culture and give an opportunity to brainstorm for everyone.

## Technical part

The project is separated on two parts, client and service sides.

To run in locally we propose you using docker-compose if it's not provided it's gold time to add it by yourself.

We love writing tests. Unit, integration, api tests they all are our friends
Why it's important because it saves us from mistakes when we add new features,
when we are refactoring something, when we are fixing bugs, everywhere we can
forget something important but tests "saving our ass".
The second reason it provides documentation, shows others how to use code,the code contract etc
Next we commit contract of code.
This means that our code becomes stable, has a clear interface, and is self-describing. And forcing us think about the
code architecture.

We are forcing to create the best code as we can but on the other hand keeping balance on other important values.

Every peace of code should be merged though PRs.
It's important to show your code other and make it better as much as possible.
