# Dependency installation

>Important note: every dependency should be checked on security issues before installation.

## Before installation 
* check source code
* check amount of dependencies (if there is a lot of dependencies, it's a bad sign)
* check the number of downloads
* check the number of contributors
* check the number of issues and pull requests
* check the number of stars
* check the number of releases (if there are no releases, it's a bad sign, remember that some bugs can be fixed only with your PR)
* check the number of open issues
* check the number of closed issues
* check the number of open pull requests
* check the number of closed pull requests
* check the number of commits
